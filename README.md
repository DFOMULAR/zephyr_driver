# Workshop: Zephyr Device Driver

Welcome to the Zephyr Device Driver workshop! By the end of this workshop, you should have a broad overview of how a device driver is written, connected to the Devicetree, and then used in a simple example application.

> **Note**: Writing a device driver involves multiple tools, languages, and configuration file syntaxes. If this is your first time working with Kconfig and Devicetree, know that it will likely be overwhelming at first. This workshop will provide you with a barebones example and then point you to various resources should you wish to dive deeper into these concepts.

> This workshop was tested with Zephyr RTOS v3.7.0.

**%%%TODO: Fritzing image**

## Toolchain Installation

To start, download this repository somewhere on your computer (using `git` or direct download + unzip).

[The Zephyr Project](https://zephyrproject.org/) is not like other IDEs or toolchains: it relies a wide collection of tools with a strong focus on Linux as the host operating system. Windows and macOS are both officially supported, but installing the toolchains on them can be burdensome.

To create a unified experience for this workshop, this tutorial demonstrates everything using the [pre-made VS Code Docker image](https://github.com/ShawnHymel/vscode-env-zephyr).

> **Note**: In all cases, you should mount the *workspace/* directory from this repository into the container (which we do with the `-v` argument). That gives us a place to modify/save code so that you can take it with you after the workshop.

> **Warning**: I recommend deleting the container after using it (hence the `--rm` argument) to keep everything clean. Any changes in the container outside of the */workspace/* directory (which we mount from the host) **will be deleted**!

(Optional) If you do not want to use Docker, you are welcome to install Zephyr manually on your host operating system by [following these instructions](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html). Be warned: the installation locations might affect the flow of this workshop, and you will likely spend some time correcting paths. Zephyr, by default, wants you to install all the RTOS source code and SDK toolchains inside your single, large project. This is an extremely bloated way to develop one-off, smaller projects. As a result, we'll be using something similar to their [T3: Forest topology directory structure](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/workspaces.html#t3-forest-topology).

> **Note**: the instructions below were verified with Python 3.12 running on the host system. If one of the *pip install* steps fails, try installing exactly Python 3.12 and running the command again with `python3.12 -m pip install ...`

Before you start, install the following programs on your computer:

 * (Windows) [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
 * [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
 * [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Open a terminal, navigate to this directory, and install the following dependencies:

Linux/macOS:

```sh
cd workshop-zephyr-device-driver/
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install pyserial==3.5 esptool==4.8.1
```

Windows:

```bat
cd workshop-zephyr-device-driver/
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install pyserial==3.5 esptool==4.8.1
```

**Option 1**: Build the Docker image (this will take some time):

```sh
docker build -t env-zephyr-espressif -f Dockerfile.espressif .
```

**Option 2**: Load a pre-made Docker image

If this is an in-person workshop, I should have USB flash drives with the necessary installers and pre-made images, as conference WiFi connections can sometimes be spotty. Copy the Docker image for your architecture (`*-amd64.tar` for x86_64 processors or `*-arm64.tar` for ARM64 processors like the Mac M1, M2, etc.) to your computer (e.g. *Downloads/* directory). Run the following command to load the Docker image (where `<ARCH>` is either `amd64` or `arm64`):

```sh
cd Downloads/
docker load -i env-zephyr-espressif-<ARCH>.tar
```

The Docker image includes all of the necessary Zephyr RTOS and SDK elements, the toolchain for building ESP32 applications, and a VS Code Server instance. As a result, you have a few options for interacting with the image: VS Code Server or Interactive Container. Choose one from below:

### (Recommended) VS Code Server

> **Note**: The rest of this tutorial assumes you will be using this method.

Open a terminal (or command prompt), navigate to this directory and run the Docker image:

Linux/macOS:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -v "$(pwd)"/workspace:/workspace -w /workspace env-zephyr-espressif
```

Windows:

```bat
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -v "%cd%\workspace":/workspace -w /workspace env-zephyr-espressif
```

Leave that terminal window open, as it will act as our server. Open a browser on your host OS (verified working on Chrome) and navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/). It should connect to the container's server, and you should be presented with a VS Code instance.

### Interactive Container

If you don't want to use the VS Code server, your other option is to run an interactive container and edit your *workspace/* files locally (using your favorite editor) or in the container (using e.g. vim, nano, mcedit). To do that, override the entrypoint for the image:

Linux/macOS:

```sh
cd workshop-zephyr-device-driver/
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)"/workspace:/workspace -w /workspace --entrypoint /bin/bash env-zephyr-espressif
```

Windows:

```bat
cd workshop-zephyr-device-driver/
docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%\workspace":/workspace -w /workspace --entrypoint /bin/bash env-zephyr-espressif
```

You should be presented with a root shell prompt (`#`) in your terminal. Remember that the */workspace/* directory is shared between your host and container, so any changes to files there are reflected on both systems. You can edit files locally (with e.g. your own local VS Code) or in the container (e.g. `mcedit /workspace/apps/blink/src/main.c`).

## Build and Flash the Blink Demo

Before we start driver development, let's make sure we can build the basic blinky demo.

> **Important!** Take note of the two directories in your VS Code instance:
> * ***/workspace*** is the shared directory between your host and container.
> * ***/opt/toolchains/zephyr*** is the Zephyr RTOS source code. It is for reference only and should not be modified!

Open a terminal in the VS Code client and build the project. Note that I'm using the [ESP32-S3-DevKitC](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/hw-reference/esp32s3/user-guide-devkitc-1.html) as my target board. Feel free to change it to one of the [other ESP32 dev boards](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html#vendor=espressif).

> **Note**: Whenever you see the root bash prompt (`#`), it means you should enter those commands into a terminal in the container (browser-based VS Code instance or root shell).

```
# cd apps/blink
# west build -p always -b esp32s3_devkitc/esp32s3/procpu -- -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=boards/esp32s3_devkitc.overlay
```

With some luck, the *blink* sample should build. Pay attention to any errors you see.

![Screen Blink Build](.images/screen-blink-build.png)

The binary files will be in *workspace/apps/blink/build/zephyr*, which you can flash using [esptool](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/).

Connect the ESP32 board to your computer. In a new terminal on your **host computer**, activate the Python virtual environment (Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`, Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`) if not done so already.

Flash the binary to your board. For some ESP32 boards, you need to put it into bootloader by holding the *BOOTSEL* button and pressing the *RESET* button (or cycling power). Change `<PORT>` to the serial port for your ESP32 board (e.g. `/dev/ttyS0` for Linux, `/dev/tty.usbserial-1420` for macOS, `COM7` for Windows). You might also need to install a serial port driver, depending on the particular board.

```sh
python -m esptool --port "<PORT>" --chip auto --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -u --flash_mode keep --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect 0x0 workspace/apps/blink/build/zephyr/zephyr.bin
```

![Flash ESP32 dev board](.images/screen-flash-esp32.png)

Open a serial port for debugging. Change `<PORT>` to the serial port for your ESP32 board.

```sh
python -m serial.tools.miniterm "<PORT>" 115200
```

You should see the LED state printed to the console. Exit with *ctrl+]* (or *cmd+]* for macOS).

## Driver Directory Structure

Drivers in Zephyr require a very particular directory structure, as the C compiler, CMake, Kconfig, and the Devicetree Compiler (DTC) browse through folders recursively looking for their respective source files. By default, Zephyr wants you to develop drivers and board Devicetree source (DTS) files "in-tree," which means inside the Zephyr RTOS source code repository (located at */opt/toolchains/zephyr* for this workshop).

For large projects, this might make sense: you fork the main Zephyr repository and make the changes you need in the actual source code. You would then version control your fork of the Zephyr source code (e.g. with [west](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/index.html)). For learning purposes, this is a pain.

We are going to develop our device driver "out-of-tree," which means it will be placed in a separate folder that we later tell CMake to find when building the project. This will help keep the application and driver folders free of clutter so you can see what's going on.

To start, create the following directory and file structure in the */workspace/modules/* directory. You can do this with the VS Code instance or using `mkdir` and `touch` in the terminal. Folders end with '/' and files do not. We're just creating a skeleton right now: the files can be empty.

```
/workspace/
|-- apps/
|   `-- blink/
|       `-- ...
`-- modules/
    |-- README.md
    `-- mcp9808/
        |-- CMakeLists.txt
        |-- Kconfig
        |-- drivers/
        |   |-- CMakeLists.txt
        |   |-- Kconfig
        |   `-- mcp9808/
        |       |-- CMakeLists.txt
        |       |-- Kconfig
        |       |-- mcp9808.c
        |       `-- mcp9808.h
        |-- dts/
        |   `-- bindings/
        |       `-- sensor/
        |           `-- microchip,mcp9808.yaml
        `-- zephyr/
            `-- module.yaml
```

Some notes about the files and folder structure:

 * We're keeping things separate: application code goes in *apps/* and driver code goes in *modules/*.
 * The *CMakeLists.txt* files tell the CMake build system where to find the code for our driver.
 * The *Kconfig* files create an entry in the Kconfig system that allows us to enable, disable, and configure our software components (i.e. the driver code).
 * The *mcp9808.c* and *mcp9808.h* files hold our actual device driver code.
 * The *microchip,mcp9808.yaml* file is our *Devicetree bindings* file. It is the glue that helps connect Devicetree settings (in DTS syntax) to our code (in C). It uses the [YAML syntax](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) and can end in *\*.yaml* or *\*.yml*. 
 * The *dts/bindings/sensor/* naming and structure matters. During the build process, Zephyr looks for bindings files (\*.yaml) recursively in *dts/bindings/* folders in its *modules*.
 * Speaking of modules, the *zephyr/module.yml* file formally declares this directory (*modules/mcp9808/*) as a Zephyr [module](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/modules.html) so it knows where to find the source, Kconfig, and bindings files. Once again, the folder and file name are important here: Zephyr looks for this particular file in this particular directory. It also uses the YAML syntax and must be named *module.yaml* or *module.yml*.

> **Note**: The device driver used in this example is based on the existing *zephyr/drivers/sensor/jedec/jc42* driver, with the bindings file found in *zephyr\dts\bindings\sensor\jedec,jc-42.4-temp.yaml*. We drop interrupt/trigger support and pare it down to just the essentials to demonstrate how to create an *out-of-tree* driver module. 

## Driver Header

After setting up the directory structure, we're going to write our actual driver. Let's start with our header file.

Copy the following to ***workspace/modules/mcp9808/drivers/mcp9808/mcp9808.h***:

```c
#ifndef ZEPHYR_DRIVERS_SENSOR_MICROCHIP_MCP9808_H_
#define ZEPHYR_DRIVERS_SENSOR_MICROCHIP_MCP9808_H_

#include <zephyr/drivers/sensor.h>

// MCP9808 registers
#define MCP9808_REG_CONFIG     0x01
#define MCP9808_REG_TEMP_AMB   0x05
#define MCP9808_REG_RESOLUTION 0x08

// Ambient temperature register information
#define MCP9808_TEMP_SCALE_CEL 16
#define MCP9808_TEMP_SIGN_BIT  BIT(12)
#define MCP9808_TEMP_ABS_MASK  0x0FFF

// Sensor data
struct mcp9808_data {
	uint16_t reg_val;
};

// Configuration data
struct mcp9808_config {
	struct i2c_dt_spec i2c;
	uint8_t resolution;
};

#endif /* ZEPHYR_DRIVERS_SENSOR_MICROCHIP_MCP9808_H_ */
```

There is not much here! We define some constant values and a couple of structs. The weirdest thing is the lack of public-facing functions. In most C/C++ projects, we define our API in the header file that we then `#include` in our application (or other source files). In our driver, we are going to rely on the Devicetree to define our public-facing API. We'll see how to do that in the .c file. For now, know that almost all driver functions should be private (defined as `static`) in the source (.c) file(s).

We define our I2C device register addresses, as given by the [MCP9808 datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MCP9808-0.5C-Maximum-Accuracy-Digital-Temperature-Sensor-Data-Sheet-DS20005095B.pdf). The MCP9808 has a number of extra functions that we will ignore for this workshop--namely the ability to set thresholds and toggle an interrupt trigger pin. We want to focus on the simple actions of setting the *RESOLUTION* register at boot time and then reading from the *AMBIENT TEMPERATURE* register at regular intervals.

The RESOLUTION register (address 0x08) uses just 2 bits to set the resolution. We'll create an *enum* in the Devicetree that allows users to set the resolution to one of the four available values. Our driver code will read the value from the Devicetree configuration and set the desired resolution in the register during boot initialization.

![MCP9808 resolution register](.images/mcp9808-resolution-register.png)

The AMBIENT TEMPERATURE register (address 0x05) stores temperature data in 12-bit format with an extra bit used for the sign. We'll ignore bits 13-15, as they're used for setting thresholds. This is a 16-bit register, so we'll read from the register and conver the 12-bit temperature value (plus sign bit) to a usable value in our code.

// The Devicetree build process calls this to create an instance of structs for

DT_INST_FOREACH_STATUS_OKAY(MCP9808_DEFINE)
```

There is a lot going on here, so we'll discuss the code in the following subsections. 

> **Note**: These discussions are quite lengthy. Feel free to skip them if you just want to get a working driver.

### Compatible Driver Definition

```c
// Ties to the 'compatible = "microchip,mcp9808"' node in the Devicetree
#define DT_DRV_COMPAT microchip_mcp9808
```

We define the *compatible* name as `microchip_mcp9808` using the `DT_DRV_COMPAT` macro, which is a special macro provided by Zephyr. Because I2C is a bus architecture, we could have multiple MCP9808 devices attached to the same bus (each with its own bus address). To handle this (without relying on object-oriented programming e.g. C++), we must create *instances* of our driver config, data, and API functions that exist separately of each other when we compile our code. Zephyr gives us a series of macros to help us create these instances.

You can create non-instance driver code, but we'll rely on [Zephyr's instance-based driver macros](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/dts/howtos.html#option-1-create-devices-using-instance-numbers) to help us handle multiple I2C devices on the same bus. To use them, you must define `DT_DRV_COMPAT` before calling the instance expansion macros (found at the bottom of the code). During the build process, Zephyr looks for *compatible* symbols in the Devicetree source (DTS) files that match the *compatible* symbols in both the *bindings* files (which we'll explore later) and in the driver source code.

Note that *compatible* is almost always given as `vender,device` as a standard style in Devicetree lingo. As C macro symbols do not work with commas, the comma is converted to an underscore `_` when the build system is looking for matching source code files. In other words, if you use `compatible = "microchip,mcp9808";` in your Devicetree source, you must use `microchip_mcp9808` to define the matching driver source code macro.

### Logging

```c
// Enable logging at a given level
LOG_MODULE_REGISTER(MCP9808, CONFIG_SENSOR_LOG_LEVEL);
```

The `LOG_MODULE_REGISTER` macro enables logging (for debugging and error identification) at the module level (remember, this driver is considered a *module*). We can then use macros like `LOG_DBG` and `LOG_ERR` to print messages to the console:

```c
LOG_ERR // Print ERROR level message to the log
LOG_WRN // Print WARNING level message to the log
LOG_INF // Print INFO level message to the log
LOG_DBG // Print DEBUG level message to the log
```

We can use the Kconfig system to set the log level (0-4) for our program:

 0. None
 1. Error
 2. Warning
 3. Info
 4. Debug

Note that messages at and *below* the configured log level will be printed. For example, setting the log level to 2 will print all `LOG_WRN` and `LOG_ERR` messages, but it will not print `LOG_INF` and `LOG_DBG` messages.

### Functions

```c
static int mcp9808_reg_read(const struct device *dev,
							uint8_t reg,
							uint16_t *val);
...
```

Next, we declare our functions. Note the use gratuitous use of `static` here; we want to keep these functions *private*, which means that they can only be seen by the compiler inside this file. To illistrate how a Zephyr driver *API* works, I divided the functions into *private* and *public* sections, but notice that they are still all declared as `static`.

From there, we define our functions. The register reading and writing should be familiar if you've worked with I2C devices before. If not, I recommend reading [this introduction to I2C](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c/all). In these functions, we call Zephyr's I2C API to handle the low-level functions for us.

> **Note**: Zephyr's I2C API offers a great layer of abstraction! We are not bound to using a specific chip or board hardware abstraction layer (HAL). Rather, Zephyr links to the necessary chip-specific HAL at build time when we specify the board (e.g. `west build -b <board>`). As a result, we can write truly device-agnostic driver code!

To learn about the available I2C functions, you can either navigate to the I2C header file (*zephyr/include/zephyr/drivers/i2c.h*) or view the [API docs here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/apidoc/latest/group__i2c__interface.html).

The interesting part is that we are creating *instance-specific* functions without the use of object-oriented programming. To do that, the I2C functions expect a `i2c_dt_spec` struct as their first parameter, which holds the bus (e.g. `i2c0` or `i2c1`) and device address (e.g. `0x18` for the MCP9808). These are values that get populated from the Devicetree source, rather than from your application code. For example:

```c
int rc = i2c_write_read_dt(&cfg->i2c, &reg, sizeof(reg), val, sizeof(*val));
```

Here, we perform the common pattern of writing a register address (`reg`) out to the device (at I2C address `i2c->addr`) and then reading the value from the register, which is saved to the `val` variable.

A common pattern in Zephyr is to save output values in parameters and use the return value to send a *return code* back to the caller. These codes are defined by [POSIX.1-2017](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/) and can be found in [here in the Zephyr docs](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/apidoc/latest/group__system__errno.html).

The `init` function will be registered to the kernel's boot process, and is (normally) called once prior to the application's `main()` being called.

The *public functions* adhere to the [Zephyr Sensor API template](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/apidoc/latest/structsensor__driver__api.html), which can be found in *zephyr/include/zephyr/drivers/sensor.h*. We will assign these functions to a *sensor_driver_api* struct to enforce the use of this template. While we could define our own structs, the use of such templates provide common patterns for application developers. In other words, all Zephyr *sensors* will work in similar ways.

In particular, we will define the following public API functions:

 * `sample_fetch` - The sensor takes a reading for the given channel (e.g. temperature, humidity, acceleration X, acceleration Y, etc.) and stores it in the `device` struct's `data` field.
 * `channel_get` - Get the value of the desired channel that is currently stored in the `device->data` field.

### API Assignment

```c
// Define the public API functions for the driver
static const struct sensor_driver_api mcp9808_api_funcs = {
	.sample_fetch = mcp9808_sample_fetch,
	.channel_get = mcp9808_channel_get,
};
```

After we've declared (and/or defined) our public-facing functions, we assign them to the various fields in the `sensor_driver_api` struct. In a minute, we'll use this API struct to create a *device* instance that can be called from our application code.

### Devicetree Expansion Macro

```c
#define MCP9808_DEFINE(inst)                                        		   \
																			   \
	/* Create an instance of the data struct */								   \
	static struct mcp9808_data mcp9808_data_##inst;                 		   \
                                                                    		   \
	/* Create an instance of the config struct and populate with DT values */  \
	static const struct mcp9808_config mcp9808_config_##inst = {			   \
		.i2c = I2C_DT_SPEC_INST_GET(inst),                          		   \
		.resolution = DT_INST_PROP(inst, resolution),               		   \
	};        																   \
                                                                    		   \
	/* Create a "device" instance from a Devicetree node identifier and */	   \
	/* registers the init function to run during boot. */					   \
	SENSOR_DEVICE_DT_INST_DEFINE(inst, 										   \
								 mcp9808_init, 								   \
								 NULL, 										   \
								 &mcp9808_data_##inst,						   \
				     			 &mcp9808_config_##inst, 					   \
								 POST_KERNEL,                       		   \
				     			 CONFIG_SENSOR_INIT_PRIORITY, 				   \
								 &mcp9808_api_funcs);	
```

This is the magic that connects our code to the Devicetree. So long as the `DT_DRV_COMPAT` macro has been defined prior, the Zephyr build system generates instance-based C code. It relies heavily on [macro token concatenation](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Concatenation.html), also known as *token pasting*.

The Zephyr build system automatically assigns *instance* numbers to Devicetree nodes when there are multiple instances of that node under a parent node (e.g. multiple I2C devices under an I2C bus node). We will see this in action later.

During this build process, the preprocessor takes that instance number and generates C code, defining the data, functions, etc. for that instance. For example, if we define an MCP9808 device in the Devicetree, the build system will assign it an instance number (e.g. 42). The preprocessor will then generate the code from this macro as follows:

```c
/* Create an instance of the data struct */
static struct mcp9808_data mcp9808_data_42;

/* Create an instance of the config struct and populate with DT values */
static const struct mcp9808_config mcp9808_config_42 = {
    .i2c = I2C_DT_SPEC_INST_GET(42),
    .resolution = DT_INST_PROP(42, resolution),
};

/* Create a "device" instance from a Devicetree node identifier and */
/* registers the init function to run during boot. */
SENSOR_DEVICE_DT_INST_DEFINE(42,
                             mcp9808_init,
                             NULL,
                             &mcp9808_data_42,
                             &mcp9808_config_42,
                             POST_KERNEL,
                             CONFIG_SENSOR_INIT_PRIORITY,
                             &mcp9808_api_funcs);
```

This macro is fed into the `FOREACH` macro as an argument:

```c
DT_INST_FOREACH_STATUS_OKAY(MCP9808_DEFINE)
```

This `FOREACH` macro tells the preprocessor to generate structs/functions for each instance found in the Devicetree (as long as its `status` property is set to `"okay"`).

## CMake Includes

We need to tell the build system where to find the source files. As Zephyr relies on *CMake*, that involves creating a *CMakeLists.txt* file in each of the folders leading up to the actual *.h* and *.c* files.

> **Note**: Zephyr defines a number of extra macros and functions that extend/customize CMake. You can find them in the [zephyr/cmake/modules/extensions.cmake](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/main/cmake/modules/extensions.cmake) file. 

Copy the following to ***workspace\modules\mcp9808\drivers\mcp9808\CMakeLists.txt***:

```cmake
# Declares the current directory as a Zephyr library
# If no name is given, the name is derived from the directory name
zephyr_library()

# List the source code files for the library
zephyr_library_sources(mcp9808.c)
```

Copy the following to ***workspace\modules\mcp9808\drivers\CMakeLists.txt***:

```cmake
# Custom Zephyr function that imports the mcp9808/ subdirectory if the Kconfig
# option MCP9808 is defined
add_subdirectory_ifdef(CONFIG_MCP9808 mcp9808)
```

Copy the following to ***workspace\modules\mcp9808\CMakeLists.txt***:

```cmake
# Include the required subdirectories
add_subdirectory(drivers)

# Add subdirectories to the compiler's include search path (.h files)
zephyr_include_directories(drivers)
```

## Kconfig Settings

[Kconfig](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/kconfig/index.html) is a system for configuring various software components in Zephyr and is based on the Kconfig system used for Linux. Most notably, it is used to enable/disable components (like our MCP9808 driver) as well as set various parameters.

We will define an "MCP9808" option in Kconfig that can be enabled to include the driver source code. This kind of module system helps keep the final application binary relatively small.

Copy the following to ***workspace\modules\mcp9808\drivers\mcp9808\Kconfig***:

```kconfig
# Create a new option in menuconfig
config MCP9808
	bool "MCP9808 Temperature Sensor"
	default n  		# Set the driver to be disabled by default
	depends on I2C  # Make it dependent on I2C
	help
	  Enable driver for the MCP9808 temperature sensor. This driver
	  depends on the I2C subsystem being enabled.
```

This creates a new option in our Kconfig system with the symbol *MCP9808*. The second line defines this as a boolean (with =y or =n as the only options). It also sets the default to `n` (disabled) and makes it depend on the I2C system being enabled.

Copy the following to ***workspace\modules\mcp9808\drivers\Kconfig***:

```kconfig
rsource "mcp9808/Kconfig"
```

Like with CMake, we need to tell Kconfig where to find the relevant Kconfig files. This one says to look in the *relative* source (`rsource`) of the *mcp9808/* subdirectory for a file named *Kconfig*.

Copy the following to ***workspace\modules\mcp9808\Kconfig***:

```kconfig
rsource "drivers/Kconfig"
```

This says to look in the *drivers/* subdirectory for a relevant *Kconfig* file.

Together, these files help the Zephyr build system find new (or modifications to) Kconfig options relevant to our driver.

## Bindings File

In order to connect the Devicetree settings to the driver source code so you can use it in your application, you need to create a *bindings* file. These files use the [YAML syntax](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) and create a specification for the various Devicetree properties that define the device.

Copy the following to ***workspace\modules\mcp9808\dts\bindings\sensor\microchip,mcp9808.yaml***:

```yaml
# Description of the device
description: Microchip MCP9808 temperature sensor

# Compatibility string that matches the one in the Devicetree source and 
# DT_DRV_COMPAT macro in the driver source code
compatible: "microchip,mcp9808"

# Includes common definitions from other bindings files
#  - sensor-device.yaml - common sensor properties
#  - i2c-device.yaml - common I2C communication properties
include: [sensor-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

# Defines specific Devicetree properties of the MCP9808 sensor
properties:
  resolution:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: Sensor resolution. Default is 0.0625Â°C (3).
    enum:
      - 0 # 0.5Â°C
      - 1 # 0.25Â°C
      - 2 # 0.125Â°C
      - 3 # 0.0625Â°C
```

The bindings file must define a `compatible` field. The Zephyr build system looks for this string when parsing the Devicetree source files to know what bindings (i.e. interface) to use for a given node and its associated properties. Note that the filename of the bindings file does not matter; it is this field that matters!

We also include other bindings files here to enumerate common properties found in the *sensor* and *i2c-device* bindings.

In this example, we define a custom *property* (`resolution`) in addition to the ones given by the *sensor-device* and *i2c-device* bindings. It's best to think about these bindings files as defining an interface for *nodes* in the Devicetree: it specifies the required properties, their types, possible defaults, and (optionally) acceptable values.

Even though we specify these properties in YAML syntax, we will define Devicetree nodes in Devicetree source (DTS) syntax. You can read more about writing DTS files in [this helpful Zephyr guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/dts/intro-syntax-structure.html).

## Zephyr Module

We've created the required files that define the necessary device driver, at least according to what CMake, Kconfig, the Devicetree, and the compiler want. The final piece is telling Zephyr that it should treat all of these files and folders as a *module*. If we don't do this, Zephyr will fail to build and link to our driver code. Creating a Zephyr module is relatively straightforward: we just need a *zephyr/module.yaml* file in the top directory of our directory structure.

Copy the following to ***workspace\modules\mcp9808\zephyr\module.yaml***:

```yaml
name: mcp9808
build:
  cmake: .
  kconfig: Kconfig
  settings:
    dts_root: .
```

The first key-value pair specifies the `name` of the module: *mcp9808*. We then specify how the module should be built with the `build` section:

 * `cmake` - tells the Zephyr build system where to look for CMake files (relative to the module's root directory)
 * `kconfig` - path to the *Kconfig* file in the module's root directory
 * `settings` - additional settings that Zephyr should know about
   * `dts_root` - Zephyr will look for a *dts/* directory at this location and search in there for additional Devicetree source (.dts) and bindings (.yaml, .yml) files

You can read more about [Zephyr modules here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/modules.html).

With all that in place, we're ready to build our application!
